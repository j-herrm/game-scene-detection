Scene detector for a video game which trains a tensorflow model on various game footage and creates a model which can differentiate footage between particular events in game then execute a series of macros based on the detected scene.

GUI is unfinished and some test cases were not accounted for in original development so a new version is planned to be created with improved frontend and model.
